# BTC-Trackin-App

A Desktop app which you can track BTC and set target values for both TRY and USD. When the BTC beat your target value, the app will send you a notification.

This app constructed with using ElectronJS using Coursetro course. (https://coursetro.com/courses/22/Creating-Desktop-Apps-with-Electron-Tutorial)
It requires also Node JS.
I recommend electron-builder to build this app.

You can ask and contribute the app, Enjoy :)
